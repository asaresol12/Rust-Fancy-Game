# Rust Fancy Game DEMO

Guess the Random Number

A simple command-line guessing game demonstrating the use of random number generation, loops, and match expressions.
The player attempts to guess a randomly generated number until they get it right.

Features

Generates a random number using rand

Accepts user input from the console

Uses a loop to keep the game running until the correct guess

Uses match expressions to compare guesses

Provides hints (Too High / Too Low)

 HOW IS WORKS

The program generates a random number within a given range (e.g., 1–100).

The user is prompted to enter a guess.

A match expression checks whether the guess is:

Correct

Too High

Too Low

A loop keeps the game running until the correct number is guessed.
